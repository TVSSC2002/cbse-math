\section{\textbf{Probability}}
\item Mother, father and son line up at random for a family photo. If A and B 
are two events given by A = Son on one end, B = Father in the middle, 
find P(B/A).
\item Let X be a random variable which assumes values x1,x2,x3,x4 such that\\
          $2P(X = x1) = 3P(X = x2) = P(X = x3) = 5P(X = x4).$

 Find the probability distribution of X.
\item A coin is tossed 5 times. Find the probability of getting (i) at least 4 heads, and (ii) at most 4 heads.
\item There are two boxes I and II. Box I contains 3 red and 6 black balls. BoxII contains 5 red and ‘n’ black balls. One of the two boxes, box I and box II is selected at random and a ball is drawn at random. The ball drawn is found to be red. If the probability that this red ball comes out from box II is $\frac{3}{5}$, find the value of 'n'.
